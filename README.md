# RESTful API

product microservice (REST API)
Where a “Customer” Can:
Search and list for products based on product name, product type, product category, product price range (including mix and max)  
Where A “Seller” Can
Add one or many products, can view product list added by them, can update and delete products (only added by them) 

This is a RESTful API example based on Node.js , following the **MVC pattern** i.e. Model ~~View~~ Controller.
The application is **production ready**
